# Automatic-Attendance-System
Welcome to the face recognition project! This project is designed to help you build a facial recognition system that can identify individuals from a dataset of facial images.

To get started with this project, please make sure you have the following:

A computer with a webcam.
A Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed. Recommended : default venv to create a new environment for this project.
Once you have the necessary requirements, you can begin by following these steps:

Clone the project repository from Github.
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the data_prep.py script to prepare your dataset. This script will crop and resize all images in your dataset to a consistent size and format.
Run the train.py script to train your facial recognition model. This script will use a deep learning approach to train a neural network that can identify individuals from your dataset.
Run the predict.py script to test your model. This script will use the trained model to identify individuals in real-time or on a set of test images.
In addition to the main scripts, the project repository also contains several utility scripts that can be used to visualize your dataset, visualize the neural network architecture, and evaluate your model's performance.

We recommend experimenting with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training techniques to improve the accuracy of your facial recognition system. You can also try using different datasets or incorporating additional features such as age or gender estimation.

Good luck with your project! If you have any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation or open an issue on the Github repository.
